 <h2>About Padre Developers</h2>
<p>
Padre is for the developers, especially people writing Perl 5 or Perl 6 code.
</p>
<p>
Padre is also by the developers. It would not exists without all the people
who spent their free time in developing Padre. This includes all the people: those
who write code or report bugs, translate the GUI or package Padre for the various
distributions.
</p>
<p>
In commercial products we are used to read testimonials of customers.
Here let us show the testimonials of the developers involved in creating Padre.
</p>
<p>
Let this page stand for both as a thank you note to all the people involved in the
creation of Padre and a place where they can tell you about the secret reasons they
are involved in the project.
</p>
<p>There are over 40 contributors in the Padre project. This page is maintained by the
developers themselves so you will see only people who added themselves to this page.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to <a href="/getting_involved.html">get involved</a>,
please follow the instructions on that page.
</p>
<p>
The full list of developers can be found in the source code of Padre.

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>10 years as an Ultraedit user have seen me go from enthusiast,
to ordinary user, to (attempted) contributor, to disgruntled user. It's
a great text editor, but for Perl developers the situation never
improves. Despite years of bug reporting and attempts to make my own
situation better, flaws that existed a decade ago continue to annoy me
regularly.<br />
Over the last few years years, I've known that all the elements of a
good <acronym>CPAN</acronym>-hosted <acronym>IDE</acronym> were in place (Wx, Scintilla, <acronym>PPI</acronym>) and tried to
encourage someone to build one (because I didn't have the time to lead
it).<br />
By the time Gábor took the initiative and started Padre, I was more
than ready to leave Ultraedit and move to an editor that I actually
have some control over.<br />
The sense of empowerment you get from being able to fix your own editor is the ultimate feature.<br />
</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>I follow behind all
the creative feature-production people doing destructive refactoring
and generally breaking everything. I'm responsible for the
configuration, locale, database, search, and document subsystems.<br />

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>
 I was working on a Perl 6 syntax highlighter when I heard about
 Gábor's <acronym>TPF</acronym> Perl 6 Grant. Naturally, I offered to help out and now I am the
 co-maintainer of <code>Padre::Plugin::Perl6</code> with him. My goal is to co-develop a
 state-of-the-art Perl 6 <acronym>IDE</acronym>.
</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>
I am re-writing <code>Syntax::Highlight::Perl6</code> to provide better <acronym>PPI</acronym>-like <acronym>API</acronym>.
Afterwards, we can provide better Perl 6 refactoring support.
I also wrote <code>Padre::Plugin::Ecliptic</code> to support my ambitious goal of porting
useful Eclipse features into Padre.

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>I've always wanted an editor with deep Perl integration. This project also
satisfies my curiosity for cross-platform <acronym>GUI</acronym> apps.
</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>I've taken the lead in making sure the <code>PerlTidy</code> plug-in follows all of the
new developments in the Padre-sphere. Next on the docket, a settings dialog
to customize your <code>PerlTidy</code> settings.</p>

until it works or I understand why not.
</p>


     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>
Perl is just something I liked along the way, just as Open Source is. 
</p>
<p>
So I thought it was time to give something back, so here I am.
</p>


  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>
It all started with a wiki page, thanks Gábor, put my own <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a> up so that I could hack around, 
and just started to update pages documenting how Padre worked as I went along, creating tickets in my wake.
</p>
<p>
Then I had this bright idea, or not, 
which turned into <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/PadrePluginDialog/">Padre::Plugin::Cookbook</a> 
out of which came <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/Features/EditPatch/">Patch</a>, it started as a Plugin. 

</p>
<p>
My current focus is with <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/Features/Perl5Debugger/">Debug2</a> 
and it's dependency <code>Debug::Client</code> and the current bleadperl anomalies.

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>
Having an <acronym>IDE</acronym> written in Perl is something you can't help participating.
It is possible to extend and fix errors using the language I like the most.

   <p>I am a historian/linguist/UNIX admin/programmer/dad with not enough time but who loves Perl.</p>


     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>Blame the friendly people on <acronym>IRC</acronym> (<code>#padre</code>)! In fact I was tired of the "Perl is dead" <acronym>FUD</acronym> and Padre is a very positive
answer to it. I like the idea of an <acronym>IDE</acronym> written in the same language that it targets so I can fix my own bugs.
At the same time, I learn a lot from great Perl hackers working on the project. <acronym>FOSS</acronym> software has given me so much (my profession
and hobby), so for me this is a very small payback.
</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>
Nothing big. My speciality is just using Padre and suggesting new features that we need :). Once on a while I implement one of
these small features myself like the "Toggle Comment" feature. Because I am one of those crazy people combining a day job in <acronym>IT</acronym> with
a <abbr>PhD</abbr> on a unrelated field (Linguistics and Literature) and having small kids at the same time, I don't have a lot of time. Nevertheless,
I try to do <code>svn commit</code> from time to time.

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>

</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>I'm maintaining several Padre plug-ins and the <code>zh_CN</code> translation.</p>

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>Even though I'm a "vi/vim" kind of guy for as long as I can remember, the
idea of having an actual free and open-source Integrated Development
Environment for Perl always tempted my imagination, specially when I see
what such tool can do for beginners. So, when Gábor started Padre, I felt
naturally attracted to the project. I first started translating Padre to
pt_BR, and next thing I know I'm fixing bugs and committing new features.
</p>
<p>These guys here are just too nice, it's all their fault.</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>I maintain the Brazilian Portuguese translation, and fix some bugs when
I find them. Right now I'm looking into toolbar customization and better
ways to use wxPerl for the project. I also created and maintain the Catalyst
and Mojolicious plug-ins for Padre.

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
    <p>
I've been long using vi, then Emacs, then vi again. I always wanted a
Perl <acronym>IDE</acronym> designed around Perl programming – and not added as an
afterthought. Padre has a huge potential with respect to this expectation. Being
programmed in Perl allows me to fix what i dislike in it…
 </p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2> <p>
When I'm working on Padre (which happens in bursts), I'm touching a lot
of different parts of the code base: the plug-in manager and the sessions
are my fault, so is the i18n plug-in <acronym>API</acronym>. I'm fixing stuff that annoys
me, try to sanitize fishy stuff (removing circular dependencies, etc.)
and document things that I'm forced to dig into… generally, I'm
checking the bug tracker on a regular basis and try to pick and close
random bugs. I also contributed a few plug-ins, and maintain Padre's
French translation.

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>It sounds interesting to see an <acronym>IDE</acronym> written in Perl. Also Gábor persuaded me into packaging and translating.</p>

toys in Padre. ;)</p>



     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>I kind of just started.. :). Anyway, I enjoy contributing because
the community is nice, puts up with me and my lack of knowledge about
<acronym>CPAN</acronym> and Wx, and I'm learning new things.</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>So far I have created <code>Locale-Msgfmt</code> to handle compiling
translations for Padre and the plug-ins, and I wrote the <acronym>REPL</acronym> plug-in. I
am also working on packaging the plug-ins for Debian (and Ubuntu), and
am a co-maintainer of Padre in Debian.</p>

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>I was looking for a graphical editor or <acronym>IDE</acronym> for developing Perl during
summer holidays 2009. Padre satisfied nearly all of my requirements, it was
much faster than some other and I loved the idea to be able to change the
source as needed but I didn't plan to really join the developer team due to
time issues.</p>
<p>I went to IRC to report a small bug and Gábor made me walking through the
code fixing it myself but he finally trapped me by rejecting the Trac upload
and making me commit it myself.
</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>Some smaller changes, fighting tickets and bugs and trying to convert IRC visitors

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>
Stunned at what had already been achieved with Padre 0.2, I felt it deserved
the momentum. I am compelled to make the Pod/doc browser work respectably, which
has turned into a serious yak shaving experience. I seem to yell, shout or
otherwise vent anger at software – a lot. Channelling that rage into code is
far more productive.
</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>
<code>Padre::DocBrowser</code> and its guts, the replacement of <code>PodFrame</code>. Lots of differing ways to search and index data,
<a href="http://marvinhumphrey.com/kinosearch/docs/devel/">KinoSearch</a>
is looking very promising and in Perl terms <acronym>PPI</acronym> and <code>Pod-Abstract</code> are my new
best friends. Currently bit bashing and string mashing an index of
 <a href="http://cpants.perl.org/static/cpants_all.db.gz">this</a> just for fun.

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>
I started the development of Padre as I wanted to create an editor
for people who don't know Perl yet and for people who use Perl
only as an add-on tool and thus even after several years of usage
are not very familiar with the language, its special cases and <acronym>CPAN</acronym>.</p>
<p>
I knew I cannot do that alone so I decided to try to make it interesting
enough for hard-core Perl developers to give it a try, to use it at
least in some special cases or to manage large projects and to help in
the development.
</p>
<p>
I also hope Padre can be a springboard to learn Perl 6.
</p>
<p>
I used to use vim and gvim both on
Linux and Windows but since the first release of Padre I have been
using it almost exclusively.
</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>
Everything a bit but mostly I am trying to get more people involved.

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>
I've been using Emacs since the mid-90s (although I'm no expert) and have never been able to find anything else I can work happily with, but Emacs Lisp makes my brain hurt, and <code>cperl-mode</code> struggles with the increasingly large and complex Perl applications I've been building recently - I'm looking for an alternative.<br/>
Because Padre is easily extensible in a language I speak almost natively (Perl), and because it's lighter and faster than most of the other GUI editors I've tried, it's not only my best hope of replacing Emacs, but also fun and immediately rewarding to hack on both the editor itself and plug-ins.</p>
<p>Although I don't use Padre for day-to-day development, I will be soon - once I'm happy with version control integration and Emacs key mapping, I'll be switching to it full time (which is 7.5 hours a day, 340 days a year).
</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>I've done some small mods to Padre itself to enable further work on key mapping in plug-ins, I'm working on the <code>EmacsMode</code> plug-in that provides Emacs style key mapping, and plan on integrating <a href="http://www.aarontrevena.co.uk/opensource/autodia/index.html">Autodia</a> through another plug-in some time soon.

Because I'm bored with constant quarrels how Perl belongs to the past

I think supplying the <acronym>IDE</acronym> written in Perl itself is appropriate answer
for such accusations.</p>

a commit bit!</p>

and wrote most of the Perl-specific refactoring support code using Adam's wonderful <acronym>PPI</acronym> module.
Adding more "smart" refactoring tools is currently my highest priority.

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>I was at YAPC::EU 2008 when Gábor proposed the Padre hackathon, and it sounded like fun.</p>

   <p> has been using Perl to get things done at work for years.  Has always been amazed at what some open source projects
 achieve and those involved in it.

     <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
   <p>
Perl <acronym>IDE</acronym> for Perl developers?  Awesome!
</p>
<p>
I've long wanted to see such a thing.  I have used various editors for Perl, vim, Notepad, <acronym>PFE</acronym>, and prior to Padre, Notepad++.
I watched with some interest the emerging Padre and jumped in quite early, finding that for most things it just worked.  The syntax
checking the highlighting was great.
</p>
<p>
I hung out in <code>#padre</code> and whinged about things that didn't work.  I was told to raise tickets in Trac.
</p>
<p>
When I submitted my first patch and it was accepted and applied, I was hooked!!!
</p>
<p>
Here was a project I could contribute to.
</p>

  
     <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2><p>
My first real attempt at something was with minor annoyances with <code>Padre::DocBrowser</code>.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise it's low hanging fruit like adding a dialog to the find dialog when it doesn't find what you are after.
</p>
<p>
My current focus is with <code>Padre::Plugin::SVN</code> of which I just packaged up and released <code>Padre-Plugin-SVN-0.02</code> to <acronym>CPAN</acronym>.
