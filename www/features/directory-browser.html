<h2>Design</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A collection of thoughts.</li>
  <li>Consider this to be free brainstorming</li>
</ul>

<h2>Navigation Behaviour</h2>

How do we get something that works for everyone?

<h2>1. The current situation</h2>

In preferences, the default opening folder is specified.<br>
In the top we have the UP("..") folder, which opens the parent on double-click.<br>
Below we have all the children.<br>
When double-clicking a folder among the children, that folder is set to root/base.<br>
When double-clicking a file among the children, that parent folder of that file is set to root/base.<br>
If behaviour in preferences, is set to open files = last, then the directory state as it were will be restored.<br>
If multi files are open, and tabs are shifted, the last known state of the active file will be shown.<br>
If multiple files are open in tabs, and all tabs are closed, which state will be shown in the end? = dunno yet, testing, haven't found the pattern.<br>
..is this always the case, or is there data somewhere that specifies a directory<br>
is a project? and if a folder is not a project, then it will not set to root/base?<br>

<h2>2. Different Alternatives</h2>

<h3>A. Explorer/Directory Browser</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In preferences, the default opening folder is specified.</li>
  <li>When starting padre and behaviour "open files" = "new" or "none" is set, the default opening folder is displayed. If "open files" = "last", the last state is restored.</li>
  <li>First in the top we have the UP("..") folder, which opens the parent on double-click.</li>
  <li>Second we have the name of the current folder.</li>
  <li>Third we have all the children, folders and files.</li>
  <li>When double-clicking a folder among the children, that folder is unfolded, but nothing else happens to the rest of the tree, state preserved.</li>
  <li>When double-clicking a file among the children, that file is opened in a tab in editor, but nothing else happens to the rest of the tree, state preserved.</li>
  <li>If multiple files are open, and a user switch tab, then the state is preserved.</li>
  <li>If multiple files are open, and a tab is closed, then the state is preserved.</li>
  <li>If multiple files are open, and all tabs are closed, then the state is preserved.</li>
  <li>If preferences behaviour "spatial" = true, then double clicking a folder will set that folder to root/base, otherwise, the state is preserved.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<h3>B1. Project Browser</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In preferences, the default opening folder is specified.</li>
  <li>When starting padre and behaviour "open files" = "new" or "none" is set, the default opening folder is displayed. If "open files" = "last", the last state is restored.</li>
  <li>First in the top we have the UP("..") folder, which opens the parent on double-click.</li>
  <li>Second we have the name of the current folder.</li>
  <li>Below we have all the children.</li>
  <li>When double-clicking a folder among the children, that folder is unfolded, but nothing else happens to the rest of the tree, state preserved. (Unless that folder is recognized as a Project folder, and then the the new base with that folder as base is forced).</li>
  <li>When double-clicking a file among the children, that file is opened in a tab in editor, but nothing else happens to the rest of the tree, state preserved.</li>
  <li>If multiple files are open, and a user switch tab, then the state is preserved.</li>
  <li>If multiple files are open, and a tab is closed, then the state is preserved.</li>
  <li>If multiple files are open, and all tabs are closed, then the state is preserved.</li>
  <li>If preferences behaviour "spatial" = true, then double clicking a folder will set that folder to root/base, otherwise, the state is preserved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>B2. Project Browser</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Same as B1</li>
  <li>Except, when Project Folder, "Up" is not displayed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>C. Explorer/Directory mix Project Browser</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In preferences, the default opening folder is specified.</li>
  <li>When starting padre and behaviour "open files" = "new" or "none" is set, the default opening folder is displayed. If "open files" = "last", the last state is restored.</li>
  <li>In the top we have the UP("..") folder, which opens the parent on double-click.</li>
  <li>Next we have the name of the current folder.</li>
  <li>Below we have all the children.</li>
  <li>When double-clicking a folder among the children, that folder is unfolded, but nothing else happens to the rest of the tree, state preserved.</li>
  <li>When double-clicking a file among the children, that file is opened in a tab in editor, but nothing else happens to the rest of the tree, state preserved.</li>
  <li>If multiple files are open, and a user switch tab, then the state is preserved.</li>
  <li>If multiple files are open, and a tab is closed, then the state is preserved.</li>
  <li>If multiple files are open, and all tabs are closed, then the state is preserved.</li>
  <li>If preferences behaviour "spatial" = true, then double clicking a folder will set that folder to root/base, otherwise, the state is preserved.</li>
  <li>Right-click option of folder = "set as base". With or without "UP" folder.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

A project folder have an icon for recognition.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

We are hitting the doeverythingatthesametime problem.
One idea from Alias was to have a "mode" where the user select between behaviour states 1) Explorer/Director and 2) Project.<br>
Another idea is to have two different browsers. 1) Explorer/Directory and 2) Project.<br>

<h2>IS THERE AN OBVIOUS CHOICE?</h2>

If not, lets do what ever gets implemented,<br>
and let them be optional in preferences.<br>


<h2>Additional Notes (unsorted)</h2>

Current directory browser will ignore what IT thinks are hidden files or folders, or if it's a Perl distribution, temporary directories like inc. Also blib, Makefile, pm_to_blib, _build and other things. Stuff you shouldn't have to care about. There's a toggle in the search dropdown menu. - this is again filebrowser/project browser mix which need to be investigated further, for most appropriate behaviour and implementation.
